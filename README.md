# Raft v Raft
A Garry's Mod gamemode made for the GGC competition.

## Summary
A mix between Rust and Raft where you build to survive against the harsh ocean as well as other players looking to take your materials and loot!

## Notes
The project strictly follows the [CFC styling guidelines](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_glua_style_guidelines)
